## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔍 Full scan | Paginates through all your following/followers automatically |
| 🤍 Whitelist | Click any avatar to protect accounts from the list. Persists between sessions via `localStorage` |
| 🔎 Search & filter | Filter by "not following back" or "whitelisted", search by name or @handle |

| 🚦 Rate-limit safe | Adds delays between API calls, auto-retries on 429 errors |
| 🔒 Zero data leak | Script only talks to `api.twitter.com` using your existing session |

---

## 🔒 Privacy

This script runs **entirely in your browser**. It uses X's internal API the same way the X website does — authenticated with your existing session cookies. **No data is sent to any third-party server.**

Whitelist data is stored in your browser's `localStorage` under the key `xuf_whitelist`.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Processing time scales with the number of accounts you follow
- X's free API tier rate-limits at ~15 req/15 min — the script handles this automatically
- Tested on Chrome and Firefox (Chromium-based browsers recommended)
- If the panel doesn't appear, make sure you're on x.com (not a sub-page)
